Unique complex mikrotik API communication solution.

The tik4net project provides easy to use API to connect and manage mikrotik routers via mikrotik API protocol.
It has 3 parts:
* Basic ADO.NET like API - to perform R/W access to mikrotik in both sync and async code (tik4net.dll).
* O/R mapper like highlevel API with imported mikrotik strong-typed entities. (tik4net.objects.dll) 
* Tools - semi-automatic generators of custom entity C# code (for usage with tik4net.objects.dll)

# Licenses
* Apache 2.0.

# Getting started and documentation
See project wiki for examples.
  
# ROADMAP:
* creating highlevel classes for all mikrotik entities (you can still generate your own classes)
* add SSL support
* add examples and documentation

* create and contribute to tiktop (see iftop) project
